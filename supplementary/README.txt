# ADDING LASERDIC IMAGES

Add each new laserdisc game here in a directory named {game}.daphne
where {game} is a daphne-recognized game name, such as lair or ace.

It is assumed that the framefile.txt will have the same name, e.g.
lair.daphne/lair.txt

Alternate game roms may be added without duplicate storage by
symlinking the files in one folder to another.


# ADDING ROMS

All actual roms should be added to the daphne/roms subfolder here.


# MAPPING JOYSTICK BUTTONS

(See file dapinput.ini in this directory)
