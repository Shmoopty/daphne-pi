How to compile libvldp2.so
by Matt Ownby (Mar 20th, 2003)
------------------------------

This source code is based on libmpeg2 (http://libmpeg2.sf.net).

Libmpeg2 has a nice ./configure script, which I took advantage of, but I made
my own Makefiles for the final build because I really have a hard time using
automake/autoconf.

So to compile under linux, you'd do:

	./configure
	make -f Makefile.linux

Compiling under Mac OSX is similar:

	./configure
	make -f Makefile.osx

That's all it takes.
