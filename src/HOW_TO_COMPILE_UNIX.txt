At the time of this writing, DAPHNE will compile fully under these unix'ish
platforms:
- i386 GNU/Linux (primary platform)
- i386 FreeBSD
- Sparc Solaris (untested)

MAC OSX USERS SHOULD USE THE XCODE PROJ INSIDE THE MACOSX DIRECTORY!!!
The MAC OSX Makefile method is obsolete and is no longer maintained!

--------------------------
STEP BY STEP INSTRUCTIONS:
--------------------------

- Make sure you have g++, make, and sed installed.

- Install these libraries (with headers) if you don't already have them:
	SDL 1.2 (tested with 1.2.5, older versions may work fine)
		SDL NOTE:
		To have minimum hardware acceleration, SDL needs to be built with "xv" support.
		"OpenGL" support is also recommended for better hardware acceleration.
	Ogg Vorbis (libogg, libvorbis, libvorbisfile)
	Zlib
	GLEW (http://glew.sourceforge.net)

- Now you are ready to compile. Daphne doesn't use the traditional
autoconf/automake nonsense.  Instead, it uses a separate Makefile for
each platform.  To compile under GNU/Linux, you
would type this (from the src directory):

	cp Makefile.vars.linux_x86 Makefile.vars
	make

(You'd do something similar if you were compiling under the other platforms.)

- You also need to compile libvldp2.so which comes with DAPHNE and has its
own set of instructions inside the vldp2 directory.  Go read those after
you're done here. :)
