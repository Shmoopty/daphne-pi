You can compile DAPHNE in windows using two compilers:
	Visual C++ 6
	Visual C++ 7.1 (aka Visual Studio 2003)

- Make sure you have MASM installed.  VS7.1 automatically comes with this
installed.  If you are using VS6, you may need to upgrade to service pack 5
and then install the Processor Pack in order to get MASM.  There are other ways
to get it installed, but this way requires the shortest explanation :).

- Download the SDL Development Runtime for Visual C++ from the
http://www.libsdl.org site.  At the time of this writing, the URL was
http://www.libsdl.org/download-1.2.html but it could have changed.

- Download the SDL_Mixer Development Runtime for Visual C++, from
http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/index.html .

- Download the Ogg Vorbis Win32 SDK from 
http://www.vorbis.com/download_win.psp .  At the time of this writing the latest version
was 1.0rc2 but I expect that will change very soon.

- Download the Zlib "SDK".  There are various places to get this, but I got mine from
http://www.winimage.com/zLibDll/zlib114dll.zip and I am going to assume you are using
this package as well.

- Download the GLEW win32 binaries from http://glew.sourceforge.net .  At the
time of this writing, the latest version was 1.3.4

- Extract these packages to the directories of your choice.  I recommend
extracting the SDL stuff to c:\sdl\ , the Ogg Vorbis stuff to c:\ov\ ,
the GLEW stuff to c:\glew,
and the zlib stuff to c:\zlib-1.14\ to make things organized.

- (VS7.1 users should go to Tools->Options->Projects for this next step)
From inside VS6, go to Tools->Options then click on the Directories
tab.  You will need to add new directories to the Include category to point to
the include files for the three packages you just downloaded.  For example,
you might add an entries like these:

	c:\sdl\sdl-1.2\include
	c:\sdl\sdl_mixer-1.2.0\include
	c:\ov\sdk\include
	c:\zlib-1.14
	c:\glew\include

You will also need to add entries to the Library category (as opposed to the
Include category you just added entries for).  Your library entries might
look like this:

        c:\sdl\sdl-1.2\lib
        c:\sdl\sdl_mixer-1.2.0\lib
        c:\ov\sdk\lib
	c:\zlib-1.14\dll32
	c:\glew\lib

- If you are using VS6, go to File->Open Workspace and open the daphne.dsw 
file inside the src directory.  From VS7.1, go to File->Open Solution and open
the daphne_vs2003.sln .  You should be ready to compile.  Good luck!
